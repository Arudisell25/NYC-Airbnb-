## NYC Apartment Bedroom Analysis by Neighborhood

### Data Sources

The data appears to be sourced from a real estate dataset, specifically focusing on the number of apartment listings with a given number of bedrooms in various NYC neighborhoods. The data includes:

*   **Neighborhood:**  A list of New York City neighborhoods.
*   **Number of Bedrooms:** Counts of apartments with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 bedrooms.

### Tools and Technologies Used

Given the tabular format, the following tools were likely used:

*   **Spreadsheet Software:** Excel or Google Sheets for initial data exploration and organization.
*   **Data Analysis/Visualization Software:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), R, or Tableau for more in-depth analysis and creating visualizations.

### Data Preparation and Cleaning

The data seems relatively clean, but potential steps might include:

*   **Checking for Missing Values:** Ensuring no neighborhoods have missing bedroom counts.
*   **Data Type Consistency:** Verifying that bedroom counts are numeric.
*   **Addressing Outliers:** Investigating any unexpectedly high bedroom counts in specific neighborhoods.
*   **Neighborhood Standardization:** Ensuring consistent naming conventions for neighborhoods (e.g., "Upper West Side" vs. "Upper West").

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses that can be derived from the data:

*   **Bedroom Distribution by Neighborhood:** Identifying which neighborhoods have the most apartments with a specific number of bedrooms. For example, Midtown has a large number of 1-bedroom apartments, whereas Lower East Side has a large number of 2 bedrooms.
*   **Neighborhood Bedroom Profile:** Determining the typical bedroom count distribution for each neighborhood. Some neighborhoods may skew heavily towards smaller apartments (studios, 1-bedrooms), while others may have a higher proportion of larger apartments (3+ bedrooms).
*   **Overall Bedroom Trends:** Understanding the general availability of apartments with different bedroom counts across the entire dataset.
*   **Identifying Outliers:** Pinpointing neighborhoods with unusual bedroom distributions compared to the city-wide average.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the EDA, potential conclusions and recommendations include:

*   **Targeted Marketing:** Real estate agencies can use this data to target specific neighborhoods based on the type of apartments they specialize in (e.g., focus on Midtown for 1-bedroom rentals).
*   **Investment Decisions:** Developers can use the data to identify neighborhoods where there is high demand for specific types of apartments.
*   **Understanding Housing Trends:** City planners can use this information to track changes in housing stock and identify areas where there may be a shortage of certain types of apartments.

### Future Work and Enhancements

Potential future analyses and enhancements:

*   **Price Integration:** Combine bedroom count data with pricing information to analyze rental and sale prices by neighborhood and bedroom count.
*   **Time Series Analysis:** Track changes in bedroom distributions over time to identify emerging trends.
*   **Demographic Data:** Integrate demographic data to understand the relationship between neighborhood demographics and housing preferences.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Create an interactive map or dashboard that allows users to explore the data in more detail.
*    **Calculate Percentages:** calculate percentages to give a better understanding of the numbers.
